<div id="Introduction">
<font face="Arial"><h1><b>Introduction to HTML</b></h1></font>
<p>Welcome to the world of code! Last year, millions of learners from our community started with HTML. Why? HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. It’s often the first language learned by developers, marketers, and designers and is core to front-end development work. If this is your first time touching code, we’re excited for what you’re about to create.
So what exactly is HTML? HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos. Right-click on any page on the internet, choose “Inspect,” and you’ll see HTML in a panel of your screen.<br>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:
<ul>
<li>A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.</li>
<li>In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements.</li>
<li>HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks. </li></ul>
Learning HTML is the first step in creating websites, but even a bit of knowledge can help you inject code snippets into newsletter, blog or website templates. As you continue learning, you can layer HTML with CSS and JavaScript to create visually compelling and dynamic websites.</p>
</div>

<div id="Structure">
<font face="Arial"><h1><b>Structure</b></h1></font>
<center><img src="C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\webproj\structure.png" width="30%" height="30%"></center><br>
<p>HTML is organized into a family tree structure. HTML elements can have parents, grandparents, siblings, children, grandchildren, etc.<br>
<h3>Document Type Declaration :</h3>
The document type declaration < !DOCTYPE html > is required as the first line of an HTML document. The doctype declaration is an instruction to the browser about what type of document to expect and which version of HTML is being used, in this case it’s HTML5.</p>
</div>

<div id="Element">
<font face="Arial"><h1><b>HTML Element</b></h1></font>
<p>An HTML element is a piece of content in an HTML document and uses the following syntax: opening tag + content + closing tag. In the code provided:<br>
	<ul>
<li>	< p > is the opening tag.<br>
<li>	Hello World! is the content.<br>
<li>	< /p > is the closing tag.<br></ul></p>

<h3>< html > HTML Element :<br></h3>
<p>The < html > element, the root of an HTML document, should be added after the !DOCTYPE declaration. All content/structure for an HTML document should be contained between the opening and closing < html > tags.</p>

<h3>< head> Head Element :<br></h3>
<p>The < head > element contains general information about an HTML page that isn’t displayed on the page itself. This information is called metadata and includes things like the title of the HTML document and links to stylesheets.</p>

<h3>< title > Title Element :<br></h3>
<p>The < title > element contains a text that defines the title of an HTML document. The title is displayed in the browser’s title bar or tab in which the HTML page is displayed. The < title > element can only be contained inside a document’s < head > element.</p>
&nbsp; <code style="background-color:rgb(231, 229, 229); color:darkblue"> 
	&nbsp;< html >
	&nbsp;< head >
	&nbsp;< title >Title of the HTML page< /title >
	&nbsp;< /head >
	&nbsp;< /html >  </code><br>

<h3>< body > Body Element :<br></h3>
<p>The < body > element represents the content of an HTML document. Content inside < body > tags are rendered on the web browsers.<br>
Note: There can be only one < body > element in a document.</p>
&nbsp; <code style="background-color:rgb(231, 229, 229); color:darkblue"> 
	< body >
	< h1 >Learn to code with Codecademy :)< /h1 >
  < /body >  </code><br>

<h3>< li > List Item Element :<br></h3>
<p>The < li > list item element create list items inside:<br><ul>
<li>	Ordered lists &lt;ol&gt;<br>
<li>	Unordered lists &lt;ul&gt;</ul></p>
	&nbsp; <code style="background-color:rgb(231, 229, 229); color:darkblue"> 
		< ol ><br>
		&nbsp;< li >Head east on Prince St< /li ><br>
		&nbsp;< li >Turn left on Elizabeth< /li ><br>
		&nbsp;< /ol><br>
	   
		&nbsp;< ul><br>
		&nbsp;< li >Cookies< /li ><br>
		&nbsp;< li >Milk< /li ><br>
		&nbsp;< /ul > </code><br>

<h3>< ol > Ordered List Element :<br></h3>
<p>The < ol > ordered list element creates a list of items in sequential order. Each list item appears numbered by default.</p>

<h3>< ul > Unordered List Element :<br></h3>
<p>The < ul > unordered list element is used to create a list of items in no particular order. Each individual list item will have a bullet point by default.</p>


<h3>< div > Div Element :<br></h3>
<p>The < div > element is used as a container that divides an HTML document into sections and is short for “division”. < div > elements can contain flow content such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.</p>

<h3>< br > Line Break Element :<br></h3>
<p>The < br > line break element will create a line break in text and is especially useful where a division of text is required, like in a postal address. The line break element requires only an opening tag and must not have a closing tag.</p>


<h3>< img > Image Element :<br></h3>
<p>HTML image < img > elements embed images in documents. The src attribute contains the image URL and is mandatory. < img > is an empty element meaning it should not have a closing tag.</p>
&nbsp; <code style="background-color:rgb(231, 229, 229); color:darkblue"> < img src="image.png" >	 </code><br>

<h3>< video > Video Element :<br></h3>
<p>The < video > element embeds a media player for video playback. The src attribute will contain the URL to the video. Adding the controls attribute will display video controls in the media player.</p>
Note: The content inside the opening and closing tag is shown as a fallback in browsers that don’t support the element.</p>
&nbsp; <code style="background-color:rgb(231, 229, 229); color:darkblue"> < video src="test-video.mp4" controls>
	Video not supported
  < /video>  </code><br>

<h3>< p > Paragraph Element :<br></h3>
<p>The < p > paragraph element contains and displays a block of text.</p>
&nbsp; <code style="background-color:rgb(231, 229, 229); color:darkblue"> < p >This is a block of text! Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.< /p >	 </code><br>

<h3>< h1 >--< h6 > Heading Elements :<br></h3>
<p>HTML can use six different levels of heading elements. The heading elements are ordered from the highest level < h1 > to the lowest level < h6 >.</p>
&nbsp; <code style="background-color:rgb(231, 229, 229); color:darkblue"> 
	&nbsp;< h1 >Breaking News< /h1 >
	&nbsp;< h2 >This is the 1st subheading< /h2 >
	&nbsp;< h3 >This is the 2nd subheading< /h3 >
	...
	&nbsp;< h6 >This is the 5th subheading< /h6 >	 </code><br>

<h3>< a > Anchor Element :<br></h3>
<p>The < a > anchor element is used to create hyperlinks in an HTML document. The hyperlinks can point to other webpages, files on the same server, a location on the same page, or any other URL via the hyperlink reference attribute, href. The href determines the location the anchor element points to.</p>
</p>
&nbsp; <code style="background-color:rgb(231, 229, 229); color:darkblue"> < a href="http://www.myweb.com">Visit this site< /a> <br>
	&nbsp;< a href="http://www.codecademy.com" >
		< img src="logo.jpg" >Click this image
	< /a >  </code><br>

</div>

<div id="Attributes"> 
<font face="Arial"><h1><b>HTML Attributes</b></h1></font>
<p>HTML attributes are values added to the opening tag of an element to configure the element or change the element’s default behavior. In the provided example, we are giving the <p> (paragraph) element a unique identifier using the id attribute and changing the color of the default text using the style attribute.</p>
&nbsp; <code style="background-color: rgb(231, 229, 229); color:darkblue">< p id="my-paragraph" style="color: green;">Here’s some text for a paragraph that is being altered by HTML attributes< /p></code><br>

<h3>Attribute Name and Values :</h3>
<p>HTML attributes consist of a name and a value using the following syntax: name="value" and can be added to the opening tag of an HTML element to configure or change the behavior of the element.</p>
&nbsp; <code style="background-color:rgb(231, 229, 229); color:darkblue"> < elementName name="value">< /elementName> </code><br>

<h3>alt Attribute :</h3>
<p>An <img> element can have alternative text via the alt attribute. The alternative text will be displayed if an image fails to render due to an incorrect URL, if the image format is not supported by the browser, if the image is blocked from being displayed, or if the image has not been received from the URL.</p>
The text will be read aloud if screen reading software is used and helps support visually impaired users by providing a text descriptor for the image content on a webpage.<br>
&nbsp; <code style="background-color:rgb(231, 229, 229); color:darkblue"> < img src="path/to/image" alt="text describing image" / >	 </code><br>

<h3>Unique ID Attributes :</h3>
<p>In HTML, specific and unique id attributes can be assigned to different elements in order to differentiate between them.
When needed, the id value can be called upon by CSS and JavaScript to manipulate, format, and perform specific instructions on that element and that element only. Valid id attributes should begin with a letter and should only contain letters (a-Z), digits (0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.).</p>
&nbsp; <code style="background-color:rgb(231, 229, 229); color:darkblue"> < h1 id="A1" >Hello World< /h1 > 	 </code><br>

</div>

<div id="table">
<font face="Arial"><h1><b>Table</b></h1></font>
<center><img src="C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\webproj\ta.png" width="40%" height="35%"></center><br>
<h3>< table > Table Element :</h3>
In HTML, the < table > element has content that is used to represent a two-dimensional table made of rows and columns.

<h3>< tr > Table Row Element :</h3>
The table row element, < tr >, is used to add rows to a table before adding table data and table headings.

<h3>< th > Table Heading Element :</h3>
The table heading element, < th >, is used to add titles to rows and columns of a table and must be enclosed in a table row element, < tr >.

<h3>< td > Table Data Element :</h3>
The table data element, < td >, can be nested inside a table row element, < tr >, to add a cell of data to a table.

<h3>< thead > Table Head Element :</h3>
The table head element, < thead >, defines the headings of table columns encapsulated in table rows.

<h3>< tbody > Table Body Element :</h3>
The table body element, < tbody >, is a semantic element that will contain all table data other than table heading and table footer content. If used, < tbody > will contain all table row < tr > elements, and indicates that <tr> elements make up the body of the table. < table > cannot have both <tbody> and <tr> as direct children.

<h3>< tfoot > Table Footer Element :</h3>
The table footer element, < tfoot >, uses table rows to give footer content or to summarize content at the end of a table.

<h3>rowspan Attribute : </h3>
Similar to colspan, the rowspan attribute on a table header or table data element indicates how many rows that particular cell should span within the table. The rowspan value is set to 1 by default and will take any positive integer up to 65534.

<h3>colspan Attribute :</h3>
The colspan attribute on a table header < th > or table data < td > element indicates how many columns that particular cell should span within the table. The colspan value is set to 1 by default and will take any positive integer between 1 and 1000.
</div>

<div id="form">
	<font face="Arial"><h1><b>Forms</b></h1></font>	
	<center><img src="C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\webproj\form.png" width="45%" height="35%"></center><br>
	<h3>< form > Element :</h3>
		<p>The HTML < form > element is used to collect and send information to an external source.<br>
		< form > can contain various input elements. When a user submits the form, information in these input elements is passed to the source which is named in the action attribute of the form.
		
	<h3>< input > Element :</h3>
		<p>The HTML < input > element is used to render a variety of input fields on a webpage including text fields, checkboxes, buttons, etc. < input > element have a type attribute that determines how it gets rendered to a page.
		
	<h3>< input >: Text Type</h3>
		<p>HTML < input > elements can support text input by setting the attribute type="text". This renders a single row input field that users can type text inside.
		The value of the < input >‘s name and value attribute of the element are sent as a key-value pair when the form is submitted.
		
	<h3>< input >: Number Type</h3>
		<p>HTML input elements can be of type number. These input fields allow the user to enter only numbers and a few special characters inside the field.
		The example code block shows an input with a type of number and a name of balance. When the input field is a part of a form, the form will receive a key-value pair with the format: name: value after form submission.
	
	<h3>< input >: Range Type</h3>
		<p>A slider can be created by using the type="range" attribute on an HTML input element. The range slider will act as a selector between a minimum and a maximum value. These values are set using the min and max attributes respectively. The slider can be adjusted to move in different steps or increments using the step attribute.
		The range slider is meant to act more as a visual widget to adjust between 2 values, where the relative position is important, but the precise value is not as important. An example of this can be adjusting the volume level of an application.
		
	
	<h3>< input >: Checkbox Type</h3>
		<p>When using an HTML input element, the type="checkbox" attribute will render a single checkbox item. To create a group of checkboxes related to the same topic, they should all use the same name attribute. Since it’s a checkbox, multiple checkboxes can be selected for the same topic.
	
	<h3>< input >: Radio Button Type</h3>
		<p>HTML < input > elements can be given a type="radio" attribute that renders a single radio button. Multiple radio buttons of a related topic are given the same name attribute value. Only a single option can be chosen from a group of radio buttons.
		The value of the selected/checked < input >’s name and value attribute of this element are sent as a key-value pair when the form is submitted.
	
	<h3>< input >: Password Type </h3>
		<p>The HTML < input > element can have the attribute type="password" that renders a single row input field which allows the user to type censored text inside the field. It is used to type in sensitive information.
		The value of this < input >’s name and value (actual value and not the censored version) attribute of this element are sent as a key-value pair when the form is submitted.
		The code block shows an example of the fields for a basic login form - the username and password fields.
	
	<h3>Submittable Input :</h3>
		<p>HTML < input > elements can have a type attribute set to submit, by adding type="submit". With this attribute included, a submit button will be rendered and, by default, will submit the < form > and execute its action.
		The text of a submit button is set to Submit by default but can also be changed by modifying the value attribute.
		
	<h3>< textarea > Element :</h3>
		<p>The textarea element is used when creating a text-box for multi-line input (e.g. a comment section). The element supports the rows and cols attributes which determine the height and width, respectively, of the element.
		When rendered by the browser, textarea fields can be stretched/shrunk in size by the user, but the rows and cols attributes determine the initial size.
		Unlike the input element, the < textarea > element has both opening and closing tags. The value of the element is the content in between these tags (much like a < p > element). The code block shows a < textarea > of size 10x30 and with a name of "comment".
		
	<h3>< select > Element :</h3>
		<p>The HTML < select > element can be used to create a dropdown list. A list of choices for the dropdown list can be created using one or more < option > elements. By default, only one < option > can be selected at a time.
		The value of the selected < select >’s name and the < option >’ s value attribute are sent as a key-value pair when the form is submitted.
		
	<h3>Submitting a Form :</h3>
		<p>Once we have collected information in a form we can send that information somewhere else by using the action and method attribute. The action attribute tells the form to send the information. A URL is assigned that determines the recipient of the information. The method attribute tells the form what to do with that information once it’s sent. An HTTP verb is assigned to the method attribute that determines the action to be performed.
</div>

<div id="sem">
	<font face="Arial"><h1><b>Semantic HTML </b></h1></font>
    <p>Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the code we write. Before Semantic HTML the elements didn’t have any meaning as to what it does or what content goes in it. An element such as < div > was used as a general-purpose element to create things from headers to footers to articles. With Semantic HTML we were introduced to elements that tell developers and browsers exactly what it does and what content should go in it.

	<h3>< figure > and < figcaption > :</h3>
    <p>The < figure > element is used to encapsulate media such as an image, diagram. or code snippet. The < figcaption > element is used to describe the media encapsulated within the < figure > element. Developers will normally use < figcaption > within the < figure > element to group the media and description. This way, if a developer decides to change the position of the media, the description will follow along with it.

	<h3>< section > and < article > :</h3>
    <p>< section > defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme. < article > holds content that makes sense on its own such as articles, blogs, and comments. Generally developers will use < section > to define a theme for the webpage and use < article > to write independent content for that theme. This does not mean that < article > has to be used with < section >.

	<h3>< aside > Aside Element :</h3>
    <p>The < aside > element is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element but isn’t required in order to understand the main content. Usually, this information would be in a sidebar or a location where it doesn’t obstruct the main piece of content. An example of this would be an article that discusses how to take care of a dog and next to the article an ad would appear advertising a dog grooming product.

</div>

<div id="ep">
	<font face="Arial"><h1><b>Element Placement</b></h1></font>	
<p>Semantic HTML introduces elements that can tell developers exactly what the element does or where it’s placed based on the name of that element. Some of these elements are < header >, < nav >, < main >, and < footer >. < header > describes the content at the top of the page < body >. It may include a logo, navigational links or a search bar. < nav > encapsulates the page’s navigational links. It is often placed inside the < header > or < footer >. < main > encapsulates the main content of a page between the header/navigation and the footer areas. < footer > includes the page’s footer content at the bottom of the < body >. 
	
</div>

<div id="em">
	<font face="Arial"><h1><b>Embedding Media</b></h1></font>	
<p>Semantic HTML introduces us to < video >, < audio > and < embed >. < video > allows us to add videos to our website. < audio > allows us to implement audio into our website. < embed > can be used to implement any type of media. These elements are universal in that they all use the src attribute to link the source of the content. < video > and < audio > requires a closing tag while < embed > is a self-closing tag.
